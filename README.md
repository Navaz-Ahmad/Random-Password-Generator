# Secure Password Generator

## Project Overview
The **Secure Password Generator** is a Python application that helps users create secure and random passwords based on specified criteria. Users can define the length of the password and choose which types of characters to include, such as lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. This application is built using the Tkinter library for a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features
- **Password Criteria Selection**: Users can specify the desired length of the password (between 8 and 20 characters) and select which character types to include.
- **Random Password Generation**: Generate a secure password based on the selected criteria.
- **Display Generated Password**: The generated password is displayed in the application window.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Users can easily copy the generated password to the clipboard for convenient use.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive GUI built with Tkinter for an enhanced user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language used for the application logic.
- **Tkinter**: Library used for building the graphical user interface.
